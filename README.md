## Bridging the Gap

Every year, India wastes 68.7 million tons of food, while millions go hungry. The food service sector alone accounts for 11.9 million tons of this waste. NGOs struggle with inconsistent food sources, while donors find it difficult to efficiently donate. Logistics, perishability, and awareness remain key challenges.

## Our Solution

- **Collect**: Excess food from restaurants, event venues, cloud kitchens, and government warehouses.
- **Smart Logistics**: Ensure freshness and efficiency using a smart logistics system.
- **Deliver**: Food to NGOs in need, helping those who are hungry.
- **Real-Time Reporting**: Surplus food reporting in real time. Apps can reach places where trucks can’t.
- **Dashboard**: Past surplus data, helping NGOs optimize inventory.
- **Wide Collection**: Food collected not just from restaurants but from weddings, corporate events, etc.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for restaurants, event venues, and cloud kitchens to report surplus food.
- Efficient logistics system ensuring timely collection and delivery of food.(to be implemented soon)
- Real-time updates for NGOs about available surplus food.
- Data-driven dashboard for NGOs to track past surplus and optimize future needs.
- Support for multiple sources of surplus food, including government warehouses and private events.
